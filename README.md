   # Conclusion :
   
  The majority of orders are placed by female customers in the 26â€“35 age group, primarily from the IT and Healthcare sectors in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. While their highest number of purchases is in 'Clothing      and Apparel,' their highest expenditure is observed in the 'Food' category.
